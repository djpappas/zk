- Summary: Taking care of Becky has become extremely challenging.  Surviving the effort emotionally requires significant effort.  A helpful approach is to project myself forward in time to visualize the things I can do after she leaves the house.
- In no particular order:
    - Remove the piano ([sell ](https://carusopianos.com/sell-your-piano/seller-information-form)most likely)
    - Purchase a small dinning room table for the open space in the great room
    - Paint the house - but especially the ceiling and walls in the kitchen and great room.  The sequence matters here
    - Empty the garage
        - Get a light duty dumpster and load stuff in to it
    - Donate Becky's clothes

    - Have wood laminate installed throughout the entire house (but likely in pieces)
        - Piano must go first
        - Secure a POD and put all of the house furniture in it.  Then turn the house over to a painter and flooring installation team.  Maybe reserve the master bedroom for the last room
