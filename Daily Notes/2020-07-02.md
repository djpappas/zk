Yesterday and last night was a significant challenge.  Becky was in her disordered state for most of the evening and in to the early morning hours.  It ended for good when I gave her a second Seroquel after midnight.  I was asleep by approximately 1:30.

She was awake this morning when I got out of bed but stayed in bed until after 8:30 at my encouragement.

I'm more than a little frustrated with the para-legal with whom I'm working on the Medicaid enrollment.  I feel as though I'm stepping through a series of Herculean feats.  She keeps putting hurdles in my path and delaying the process.  I would have preferred to have had a complete checklist from the beginning of the process.

My weight is up.  My lunch yesterday is likely the culprit.  BW3 wings are high in sodium.  My dinner last night was small.  I've not gotten much sleep or exercise of late - so my metabolism might also be suffering.

I've called the PBGC - Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation - and started the process to get the pension payments from the Stanreco Retirement Plan.

The IRA liquidation check has been deposited.
