Daily Note

---

- Some notes on Becky's behavior yesterday:
    - Becky woke up early and was far more alert in the morning than she had been.  She was active and more engaged with her surroundings.  Perversely, these days are a) more challenging for me as I have to keep a more watchful eye on her; and b) more disconcerting as it makes it harder to feel good about my decision to institutionalize her.  
- I continue to try to figure out the best approach to creating my 'second brain'.  Obsidian is a nice tool as is Roam.  Neither seems to align with the Zettelkasten methodology - especially with regard to documenting original notes (or fleeting notes).  Zotero is a fantastic tool for capturing and organizing information about information resources - but neither of the new generation of tools integrates with it well.
