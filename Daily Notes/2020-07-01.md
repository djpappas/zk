I have 1.5 boxes of  Jevity remain.  That gets me to the end of the day on Sunday.  Fidelity has called back and indicated they will deliver on Monday.  I will need to make certain I am conservative with the supply to get through the morning feed.

I tried to get the state and federal withholding changed on the SERS payments without success.  The buttons to edit values was not apparent.  I'll try to do so again.
